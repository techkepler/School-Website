    short_details:
      "Through the study of art, Lower School students learn to think creatively, see the world from multiple perspectives, and build a rich new language to express themselves and their artistic identities. Our curriculum synthesizes both product- and process-centered art making, while accentuating each youngster’s imagination and encouraging artistic experimentation and risk-taking. Students enjoy new media and projects in each grade, including needle felting, wood work, portraiture, line drawing, pottery, and more. In Grade 4, students sketch a famous artwork of their choice, such as a Kehinde Wiley portrait, on the seat of a stool and apply all the painting techniques they’ve learned during their time in Lower School as they paint and replicate the artwork. Students’ artwork is displayed on a rotating basis throughout the Lower School, and a formal exhibition of student work is on view during the annual Lower School Open School Night each spring.",

      "In our sun-filled Aberlin Dance Studio, students focus on the expression of feelings and ideas through imagination, gesture, and movement. Young dancers explore the gestural properties of arms, legs, hands, feet, fingers, toes, the head, and the torso. They learn ways to move and then participate in short movement projects and dance games that help train them in collaborative movement. Grades 1-4 students begin to experience and acquire an increasingly sophisticated dance vocabulary to choreograph their own pieces and perform a dance at the end of each school year for a parent audience.

      "Problem solving is at the heart of Lower School mathematics. Our research-based approach includes powerful visual models, engaging hands-on activities, and an intentional progression from concrete experiences to abstract representation as students develop their mathematical reasoning skills. Rather than focusing on rote memorization, students build their mental dexterity as they learn a number of ways to manipulate numbers and solve multi-step problems. Through school-wide math challenges curated by our Math Specialist, students can apply their skills and see themselves as mathematicians in a larger community. ",

    short_details:
      "We recognize music as essential to children’s intellectual and emotional development. Children learn a multicultural array of songs that they share with parents and friends at Grades 3 & 4 Winter Concert and Spring Concert. By the time they graduate, all our students can sing in tune and have experienced the basic orchestral instruments by playing the xylophone, recorder, and drum. Throughout the curriculum, we emphasize learning to harmonize and work together. We also encourage students to take individual music lessons after school or through our lunchtime music lessons program.",

As early as Kindergarten, young learners explore how to use scientific tools such as magnifying glasses and microscopes. Students are encouraged to ask questions, to think as scientists and develop hypotheses, and to conduct step-by-step experiments that require them to collect and organize data and draw conclusions. Sustainability projects help students understand the complexities of our shared ecosystems and engage them in thinking about solutions to the problems they identify in the world.",

    title: "Social Studies",
    short_details:
      "In the Lower School, students develop research techniques from a young age by asking questions, interviewing friends and neighbors, making observations, and visiting places of interest. As students get older, they learn to gather information from primary sources and other material, identify the characteristics of trustworthy information sources, and challenge themselves to consider history and current events from multiple perspectives. Group discussion and drawing conclusions are keystones of our curriculum as students explore essential questions, such as “How does geography affect culture?” and “How have past events shaped what’s happening today?”  Students demonstrate their understanding in a variety of experiential learning activities, from walking across the Brooklyn Bridge as they study the story of its construction and visiting the Japan Society to extend their study of the country to writing reports about and creating models of different communities of the past. Field trips and exposure to authentic artifacts and activities play an integral role in enriching our social studies curriculum.",

      "At the core of the History Department’s mission is the belief that the study of history has the potential to, in the words of historian Carl Degler, “expand our conception and understanding of what it means to be human.” The study of history is integral to Poly’s mission of preparing students to be global citizens, and our history curriculum is designed to help students become comfortable navigating, both in the past and in the present, the tension between the familiar and the strange. To this end, students develop a deep knowledge of their own country’s history, global history, and area-specific histories. We also empower students to seek an understanding of their world that goes beyond their present moment, and to develop the empathy and humility that are integral to the thoughtful exercise of global citizenship.",

We help students recognize patterns and structures, explore multiple routes to solving problems, develop and apply critical thinking and abstract reasoning skills, and organize and explain their reasoning, both orally and in writing. As we model real-world situations and promote both deductive and inductive reasoning, our students develop the intellectual tools and confidence to persevere through complex and challenging non-routine problems, and enjoy the challenge of attempting to find the unknown and delight in its discovery.",

Students develop a strong base in traditional practice and materials, while being encouraged to develop their own eye and methods. They experiment, take risks, and solve problems. They look closely, ask questions, see alternate perspectives, and make connections. Through our Arts Partnerships, they meet inspiring professional artists (and arts professionals through our collaborations with cultural institutions) from whom they tap invaluable creative energy to explore and hone their own crafts.
